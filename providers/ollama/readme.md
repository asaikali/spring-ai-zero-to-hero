To run the sample application you will need an Open API key. The key
needs to be stored `src/main/resources/creds.yaml` file. 

If you have your own api key, copy the `src/main/resources/creds-template.
yaml` to `src/main/resources/creds.yaml` and add your key.

If you don't have your own key the instructor will provide you with `creds.yaml`
file you will need to put this file in `src/main/resources/creds.yaml`.


Run the application, it is better to run the app from the IDE so that you can 
put breakpoints.
